#  description: A fundamental question in connectomics is how the organization of brain networks supports neural signalling. Using anatomically realistic networks derived from diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), we develop analytic and computational models of communication, diffusion and spreading. We use these models to characterize how communication processes unfold on structural brain networks and to individual differences in cognitive performance.
